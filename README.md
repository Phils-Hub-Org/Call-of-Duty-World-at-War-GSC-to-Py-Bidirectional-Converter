A Call of Duty: World at War Gsc to Py Bidirectional Converter

Run the executable.

Open a .gsc file or paste some .gsc code into the text area.

Hit the convert to Py button.

Similary, do the same for when wanting to convert .py to .gsc (Note: Due to python not being a capped lang, please refer to the documention for more information on exactly what python code the tool accepts as we can't account for all future python changes.)

Peace!
